## ensō ring |

a contemplative digital object

An enso circle or ensō (円相) is a minimalist Japanese symbol that features a simple, circular shape that is not filled in, drawn to leave out the outline.

ensō rings represent enlightenment. Enlightenment can be defined as an awakening or understanding of something. With it, your goal is to be enlightened about the beauty of change and emptiness. 

I tried to simulate the quality of the ink and watercolor as a living process. A mutating process as an object that is not completely finished yet perfectly complete.

"Form is emptiness (śūnyatā), emptiness is form."

Contemplation of the Body (Ānāpānasati)

     Breathing in long, the practitioner knows  ‘I am breathing in long.’
     
     Breathing in short, the  practitioner knows ‘I am breathing in short.’
     
     Breathing out long, the practitioner knows ‘I am breathing out long.’
     
     Breathing out short, the practitioner knows ‘I am breathing in short.’
     
     The practitioner trains with ‘breathing in, I experience the whole body.’
     
     ‘Breathing out, I experience the whole body.’
     
     The practitioner trains with, ‘breathing in, I calm the bodily formation.’
     
     ‘Breathing out, I calm the bodily formation.’
