## ensō ring |

a contemplative digital object


An enso circle or ensō (円相) is a minimalist Japanese symbol that features a simple, circular shape that is not filled in, drawn to leave out the outline.
ensō rings represent enlightenment. Enlightenment can be defined as an awakening or understanding of something. With it, your goal is to be enlightened about the beauty of change and emptiness. 
I tried to simulate the quality of the ink and watercolor as a living process. A mutating process as an object that is not completely finished yet perfectly complete.
"Form is emptiness (śūnyatā), emptiness is form."
